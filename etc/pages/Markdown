# Markdown Overview

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

You may, however, manually insert newlines,
like so.

*Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace` are inline styles.

> Block quotes are indicated with >'s.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar). Here's a link to a [local
doc](Index). Here's a wikilink to the [[index]]. Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Footnote text goes here.


## Lists

Unordered lists use dashes or asterixes, e.g.:

- item one;
- item two;
- item three.

Numbered lists start with numbers, e.g.:

1. first item;
2. second item;
3. third item.

Defnition lists start with colons, e.g.:

Apples
: Good for making applesauce.

Oranges
: Citrus!

Tomatoes
: There's no "e" in tomatoe.


## Code

Here's a code sample:

    for i in range(10):
        print i

Instead of indenting the block, you can use fenced blocks (which makes copying & pasting easier):

~~~
for i in range(10):
    print i
~~~

You can optionally mark the fenced block to syntax highlight it:

~~~python
for i in range(10):
    print i
~~~


## Nesting Syntax

Now a nested list:

1. First, get these ingredients:

    * carrots
    * celery
    * lentils

2. Boil some water.

3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.


## Tables

Tables can look like this:

size | material     | color
---- | ------------ | ------------
9    | leather      | brown
10   | hemp canvas  | natural
11   | glass        | transparent


## Math

Inline math equations go in like so: \(omega = d\phi / dt \). Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

\[ I = \int \rho R^{2} dV \]

Thats it.
