- ACE parsing should be able to pick up arguments to predicates:
    "ALLOW ROLE('something') ANY" or
    "ALLOW ROLE.something ANY" or
    ('ALLOW', Role('wheel'), 'ANY')


- Figure out what to do about ANY/ALL.

- Should we have a mechanism for an ACL being different on a class vs its
  instance, or should we do that via a @classproperty?

  @classproperty
  def __acl__(cls, self):
    '''self may be None'''


Put the predicate context onto a Flask stack proxy?

    from flask.ext.acl import predicate_context


@auth.predicate('ROOT')
define Root(user, **ctx):
    return 'wheel' in getattr(user, 'roles', set())


- Permission checks via functions too?

    @auth.permission('ANY'):
    define AnyPermission(permission):
        return True

    Or, treat different types differently:


    use for:
        delete -> delete, write, read
        write -> write, read
        read -> read


@flask.ext.acl.register_predicate
