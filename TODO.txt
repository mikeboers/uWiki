- Titles should be able to have whatever does not need to be escaped

- PageURL which is what is first consulted to resolve pages
    page_id
    slug
    created_at

    Page.primary_url_id

- table of contents from headers
    [[ INDEX -R ]]

    We should consider a rst-like syntax: .. index


- uploading assets to /media
  - image resizing

- abstract pages and images to "media"
    - "media_object" and "media_version" tables
    - they are roughly the same, except in how they repreent their "content"

- preserve permissions in media versions

- a DSL for permissions?
    - is there a clear permission heirarchy?
        No! `write` -> `read`, but neither implies `pass` or `list`.

    - eg1
        authed write; all read,list,pass
