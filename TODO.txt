- Titles should be able to have whatever does not need to be escaped

- PageURL which is what is first consulted to resolve pages
    page_id
    slug
    created_at

    Page.primary_url_id

- table of contents from headers
    [[ INDEX -R ]]

    We should consider a rst-like syntax: .. index


- uploading assets to /media
  - image resizing

- abstract pages and images to "media"
    - "media_object" and "media_version" tables
    - they are roughly the same, except in how they repreent their "content"

- Restore permissions:

    - The logical place for ACLs is on media_versions, so that they are
      versioned.
    - They should also be checked against the current master ACL in case
      they are more restrictive.
    - The common case would only have us looking at the current ACL, so we
      don't really need to optimize for historical stuff.


- Should Flack-ACL only parse permissions if the whole thing was given as a string?

- Should page URLs be /wiki/ or /page/ ??

  wiki.mm/page/Index
  wiki.mm/wiki/Index

  If we go with /page/, then we can do away with the complex mapping back and forth.
